GOV.UK Bank Holidays
====================

This library loads the official list of bank holidays in the United Kingdom as supplied by `GOV.UK`_.
GOV.UK tend to provide this list for only a year or two into the future.

A cached backup list of known bank holidays is stored in this package though it is not updated often.
GOV.UK no longer provide bank holidays for some of the older years still part of this backup list.

Usage
-----

Install using ``pip install govuk-bank-holidays``. Sample usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from govuk_bank_holidays.bank_holidays import BankHolidays

    bank_holidays = BankHolidays()
    for bank_holiday in bank_holidays.get_holidays():
        print(bank_holiday.title, 'is on', bank_holiday.date)
    print(bank_holidays.get_next_holiday())

    # see govuk_bank_holidays/bank_holidays.py source file for more methods and argument details…

    # choose a different locale for holiday titles and notes
    bank_holidays = BankHolidays(locale='cy')

    # use cached holidays if internet connection is not desired
    bank_holidays = BankHolidays(use_cached_holidays=True)

Bank holidays differ around the UK. The GOV.UK source currently lists these for 3 "divisions":

- England and Wales
- Scotland
- Northern Ireland

… and many methods in this library take a ``division`` parameter (see constants defined in ``Division`` enum).

NB: If no division is specified, only holidays common to *all* divisions are returned so some local bank holidays
may not be listed. Therefore specifying a division is recommended.

While localisation is provided in English (the default with locale code 'en') and Welsh (locale code 'cy'),
please note that the Welsh version may contain errors.

Please report bugs and open pull requests on `GitHub`_.

Update cached bank holidays from GOV.UK using ``python setup.py updatecachedholidays``.

Update translation files using ``python setup.py makemessages``, e.g. when updating the i18n module or when adding new languages.
Compile them using ``python setup.py compilemessages``; this is *required* before testing and distribution.

Use ``python setup.py compilemessages test`` to run all tests locally.
Alternatively, you can use ``tox`` if you have multiple python versions.

Distribute a new version to `PyPI`_ by:

- updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``govuk_bank_holidays``
- adding a note to the `History`_
- publishing a release on GitHub which triggers an upload to PyPI

Alternatively, run ``python setup.py compilemessages sdist bdist_wheel upload`` locally.

History
-------

Unreleased
    Added stronger typing throughout, though the api remains largely the same:
    bank holidays now have their own type ``BankHoliday`` (though dictionary-based access is retained; i.e. ``bank_holiday.title`` and ``bank_holiday['title']`` are equivalent),
    UK "divisions" are now defined by a new enum class ``Division``,
    all methods have typing hints.
    Made ``data`` attribute of ``BankHolidays`` class private.
